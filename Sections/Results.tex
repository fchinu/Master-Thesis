\chapter{\texorpdfstring{\ds/\dpl production-yield ratio}{Ds+/D+ production-yield ratio}}\label{ch:results}
The \pt-differential \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio can be evaluated using the quantities obtained in Chapters~\ref{chap:RY} and~\ref{ch:corrections}. The \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio is defined using Eq.~\ref{eq:DsDplusRatio}, here reported for convenience:
\begin{equation*}
    \ds/\dpl = \frac{N_\mathrm{raw}^{\ds}\cdot \fpds}{\aeffpds \cdot \mathrm{BR}^\ds} \cdot \left(\frac{N_\mathrm{raw}^{\dpl}\cdot \fpdpl}{\aeffpdpl \cdot \mathrm{BR}^\dpl}\right)^{-1}\quad .
\end{equation*}
Previous measurements have been performed at different centre-of-mass energies and rapidity windows, and it is therefore interesting to investigate whether the \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio depends on either of these variables. In addition, several models have been developed to describe the production of the two D-meson species, and the \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio can be used to test their validity. 

Using the factorisation theorem~\cite{Collins:1989gx}, from Eq.~\ref{eq:pp_xsec}, the \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio can be expressed as
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\left.\frac{\de^2\sigma}{\de\pt\de y}\right\vert^\ds_\mathrm{prompt}}{\left.\frac{\de^2\sigma}{\de\pt\de y}\right\vert^\dpl_\mathrm{prompt}} \sim \frac{D_\mathrm{c\overline{c}\rightarrow \ds}(z,\mu_\mathrm{F}^2)}{D_\mathrm{c\overline{c}\rightarrow \dpl}(z,\mu_\mathrm{F}^2)}\quad ,
\end{equation*}
where $D_\mathrm{c\overline{c}\rightarrow \ds (\dpl)}(z,\mu_\mathrm{F}^2)$ are the fragmentation functions of the charm quark for the hadronisation into a \ds (\dpl) meson. These studies therefore provide information on the energy and rapidity dependence of the fragmentation functions, and, potentially, constraints for these quantities.

The phenomenon of strangeness enhancement is expected to be established when a parton-rich environment is formed. The charged-particle multiplicity of a collision is observed to increase with the centre-of-mass energy of the event~\cite{ALICE:2020swj} because the larger energy available can be used to produce more particles. Therefore, an enhancement in the production of strange hadrons can be expected with the increase in the energy available in the collision. The dependence on the centre-of-mass energy of the \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio can be studied by comparing the results obtained in this Thesis in pp collisions at \thirteen with those obtained, in the same rapidity window of \mbox{$\lvert y\rvert<0.5$}, by the ALICE Collaboration in pp collisions at the centre-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s} = 5$, 7, and 13~\tev (taken from Refs.~\cite{ALICE:2021mgk,ALICE:2017olh,ALICE:2023sgl}, respectively). Given the small difference of a few \tev between the considered measurements, a very small effect on the \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio is expected. The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dsdplvsenergy}, with red markers being used for the measurement performed in this Thesis. The statistical uncertainties are reported using vertical bars, while the systematic uncertainties are shown as boxes. Thanks to the upgrade to the ALICE experimental apparatus~\cite{ALICE:2023udb}, a very large number of minimum-bias events was recorded. In one year of Run~3 data-taking, an integrated luminosity larger than that of the entire Run~2 was collected. In addition, previous measurements of the \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio reconstructed the \dpl meson through the $\dpl\rightarrow\pi^+\mathrm{K}^-\pi^+$ decay channel, which differs from that exploited in this analysis. Despite being characterised by a larger BR of \mbox{$(9.38\pm0.16)\times10^{-2}$}~\cite{pdg}, which leads to a larger amount of reconstructed \dpl mesons, the reconstruction through the same decay channel used for the \ds meson, $\dpl \rightarrow \mathrm{\phi\pi^+ \rightarrow K^+K^-\pi^+}$, allows for the cancellation of some of the systematic uncertainties in the \ds/\dpl ratio. Thereby, a high-precision measurement of the \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio was achieved in this Thesis. Both statistical and systematic uncertainties have been significantly reduced with respect to previous results. Moreover, the \pt reach of the measurement has been extended to lower values, down to $\pt=0.5$~\gevc, and narrower \pt intervals have been analysed. The results from this Thesis present a steeply-increasing \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio between the first two \pt intervals, followed by hints of a decreasing trend with \pt from 1 to 2.5~\gevc and an increasing one for $\pt>2.5$~\gevc. The comparison with previous measurements at midrapidity performed by the ALICE Collaboration at the centre-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s} = 5$, 7, and 13~\tev show no significant dependence on the centre-of-mass energy, with results being compatible within uncertainties across the whole analysed \pt and \sqs ranges. The comparison with the results obtained at \mbox{$\sqs=13$~\tev} shows that a slightly larger \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio is measured at low \pt at \mbox{\thirteen}. However, the large uncertainties in the previous measurement prevent any firm conclusion on any energy dependence of the observable. In addition, large fluctuations may be present in the results obtained at $\sqrt{s} = 13$~\tev, as can be deduced from the different trends of the $\dpl/\mathrm{D^0}$ production-yield ratio compared to that measured at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ and 7~\tev.

\section{Dependence on rapidity}

\end{figure}
Measurements of the \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio in different rapidity intervals can provide further insights into the hadronisation mechanism. At forward rapidities, the production of particles closer to the beam remnants is probed. In this phase space region, more interactions between the fragments of the colliding hadrons and the partons produced in the hard-scattering processes taking place in the collision than those observed at midrapidity may occur. Therefore, the hadronisation mechanism might differ from that at midrapidity. Measurements performed at forward rapidity by colliding a beam of $\pi^\pm$, $\mathrm{K^\pm}$, or protons on a nuclear target at the low energy of 250~\gev by the E769 Collaboration at Fermilab~\cite{E769:1996jqf} indicated the presence of an asymmetric production of leading and subleading charm particles. The term \emph{leading} particle refers in this context to a charm particle that shares at least one light quark or antiquark flavour with the beam particle. On the contrary, recent measurements performed by the ALICE Collaboration demonstrated a balance in the production of particles and antiparticles~\cite{ALICE:2023ulv}. This suggests that the hadronisation mechanism may undergo a change in the vicinity of the beam remnants. At the LHC energies, rapidities of around 10 are reached by both colliding protons in the laboratory frame. FONLL calculations~\cite{Cacciari:1998it} for the $y$-differential charm-quark production cross-section in pp collisions at \thirteen predict an almost rapidity-independent cross-section for $\lvert y\rvert<4$ and a steeply-falling trend with rapidity for $\lvert y\rvert>4$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:FONLLVsY}. The LHCb experimental apparatus is able to perform measurements at forward rapidity, but does not reach such large $y$ values to probe the decreasing trend of the charm-quark production cross-section. Therefore, it is not expected to observe significant differences between measurements performed at midrapidity and forward rapidity.

    \label{fig:dsdplvsrapidity}
\end{figure}

The rapidity dependence of the \ds/\dpl produciton-yield ratio can be investigated by comparing the measurement at midrapidity ($\lvert y\rvert<0.5$) performed in this Thesis in pp collisions at \thirteen with those performed at forward rapidities by the LHCb Collaboration~\cite{LHCb:2015swx} at a similar centre-of-mass energy of $\sqs=13$~\tev. Given the energy-independence of the observable which has been discussed above, it is possible to directly compare the two measurements. Figure~\ref{fig:dsdplvsrapidity} shows the comparison between the \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio measured in this work compared to that from the LHCb Collaboration measured in pp collisions in the $2.0<y<2.5$ and $2.5<y<3.0$ rapidity intervals. Thanks to the large dataset available and the reconstruction of the two D-meson species through the same decay channel, the uncertainties of the measurement are significantly smaller than those of the LHCb results across a wide \pt range. In addition, the \pt reach of the measurement is extended to lower values. The results obtained at midrapidity and forward rapidity show a similar trend, with the three \ds/\dpl production-yield ratios compatible within uncertainties across the whole studied \pt range. The comparison between the results obtained at midrapidity and forward rapidity shows no significant dependence of the \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio on the rapidity of the measurement.


Other measurements performed at forward rapidity by the LHCb Collaboration in p--Pb collisions at $\snn=8.16$~\tev~\cite{LHCb:2023rpm} present an enhancement of the \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity across the studied \mbox{$2<\pt<12$~\gevc} interval. These results were obtained by determining the charged-particle multiplicity of the collision using a detector capable of measuring the number of produced particles in the same rapidity interval studied for the analysis of the D-meson production. This may lead to possible biases in the measurement, as heavy-flavour hadrons are typically produced in jets, and auto-correlations between the charged-particle multiplicity and the D-meson production may be present. The ALICE apparatus overcomes these limitations, as the charged-particle multiplicity of events containing D mesons in the central barrel can be measured with forward-rapidity detectors, such as the FV0 and the two arrays of the FT0 detector. Therefore, future measurements of the multiplicity dependence of the \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio performed by the ALICE Collaboration are expected to provide a more accurate determination of the observable, and to be less affected by biases due to the presence of auto-correlations between the D-meson production and the charged-particle multiplicity of the collision. 
\section{Comparison to models}
\begin{figure}[htb]

    \caption{\pt-differential \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio measured at midrapidity ($\lvert y\rvert<0.5$) in pp collisions at \thirteen by the ALICE Collaboration. The results obtained in this Thesis (red) are compared with different theoretical predictions.}
    \label{fig:dsdplvsmodels}
\end{figure}
The \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio can be used to test the validity of models describing the production of the two D-meson species, and set constraints on their description of the hadronisation process. Figure~\ref{fig:dsdplvsmodels} presents a comparison between the \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio measured in this Thesis at midrapidity ($\lvert y\rvert<0.5$) in pp collisions at \thirteen with the ALICE experiment (red markers) and theoretical predictions. 

Predictions from \textsc{Pythia}~8~\cite{Bierlich:2022pfr} are reported using the Monash 2013 tune~\cite{Skands:2014pea} (blue filled boxes), which tunes its hadronisation description on results from \ee collisions, and colour-reconnections beyond the leading-colour approximation~\cite{Christiansen:2015yqa}. The associated uncertainties are due to the limited amount of simulated pp collision events. Three colour reconnection modes (Mode 0,2,3) are reported in green, violet, and orange, and present similar trends with \pt, with values compatible within uncertainties. \textsc{Pythia}~8 predictions with Monash 2013 tune present a similar dependence on \pt, with a predicted \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio that is larger than that with colour-reconnections beyond the leading-colour approximation. Nonetheless, the four predictions underestimate the measured \ds/\dpl ratio, by a factor of about 1.5 at intermediate \pt. This discrepancy is also observed in the measurement of the \pt integrated $\ds/\mathrm{D^0}$ and $\dpl/\mathrm{D^0}$ production-yield ratio in pp collisions at 5.02~\tev performed by the ALICE Collaboration~\cite{ALICE:2021dhb}, where the same \textsc{Pythia}~8 predictions slightly underestimate the \ds-meson production and overestimate that of \dpl mesons.

Predictions from the Catania model~\cite{Minissale:2020bif}, which describes the production of small droplets of QGP in pp collisions, implementing both the coalescence and fragmentation mechanisms for charm quarks, are reported with a violet dashed line. The model provides a good description of the \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio, managing to reproduce both the magnitude and the general trend with transverse momentum. 

Lastly, predictions from POWLANG~\cite{Beraudo:2023nlq}, are also reported. Similarly to the Catania model, POWLANG predicts the formation of a small deconfined system in pp collisions, and the same in-medium hadronization mechanism developed for heavy-ion collisions is employed. Two sets of predictions are reported, employing transport coefficients calculated by weak-coupling~\cite{Braaten:1989mz} (Hard-Thermal-Loop, HTL) and lattice-QCD calculations~\cite{Altenkort:2023oms}, using blue and green dashed lines, respectively. Both predictions overestimate the measured \ds/\dpl production-yield ratio, by a factor of about 1.5 at intermediate \pt. In addition, a strong decreasing trend with \pt is predicted, but not observed in the data. These discrepancies are also observed in the measurements of the \pt-differential $\ds/\mathrm{D^0}$ and $\dpl/\mathrm{D^0}$ production-yield ratios in pp collisions at 5.02~\tev performed by the ALICE Collaboration~\cite{Beraudo:2023nlq}, where the POWLANG predictions overestimate the \ds-meson production, with similar differences in the description of the \pt-dependence, while an accurate description of the \dpl meson is achieved.
