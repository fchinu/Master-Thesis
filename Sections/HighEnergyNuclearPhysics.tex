\section{Quantum Chromodynamics}
In the mid-20$^{\mathrm{th}}$ century, the realm of particle physics underwent a transformative phase, marked by the discovery of a seemingly endless variety of subatomic particles. This era witnessed the unveiling of numerous hadron species, which left physicists with the necessity of developing a framework that could describe the behaviour of these particles and their interactions. This led to the development of the static quark model, which emerged in the 1960s as a groundbreaking conceptual framework to categorise the various observed particles. Developed independently by Murray Gell-Mann~\cite{Gell-Mann:1964ewy} and George Zweig~\cite{Zweig:1964jf, Fritzsch:1972jv}, this model postulated the existence of fundamental constituents of hadrons called quarks, which, in order to reflect the experimental findings, had to be fermions (to describe baryons with spin 1/2 and 3/2) with fractional electric charge. The quark model beautifully explained the organisation of the known hadrons in terms of three quarks ($u$, $d$, and $s$), leading to the development of a more structured and coherent classification of particles.

Despite the phenomenological success of the static quark model, it had two problems: it introduced particles with fractional charge, which had never been observed before, and, most importantly, it gave rise to a violation of the Fermi-Dirac statistics. The $\Delta^{++}$, $\Delta^{-}$, and $\Omega^{-}$ baryons, in fact, have symmetric orbital, spin, and flavour wavefunctions, which defied the Pauli exclusion principle that should have implied antisymmetric wavefunctions for these particles. To resolve these inconsistencies, a new degree of freedom, the \emph{colour}, was introduced. Hadron wavefunctions were assumed to be totally antisymmetric in colour quantum numbers, effectively implementing the Pauli exclusion principle.

The simplest model of colour would be to assign quarks to the fundamental representation of a global $SU(3)$ symmetry. Each quark carries a colour index: $q_i$, where $i = 1, 2, 3$, and transforms under the fundamental ($3$) representation of $SU(3)$, while antiquarks,  $\bar{q}_i$, transform in the $\bar{3}$ representation. Introducing the totally antisymmetric tensor $\varepsilon^{ijk}$, possible compositions of quarks that give rise to colour singlets are 
\begin{equation*}
    \bar{q}^iq_i,\qquad \varepsilon^{ijk}q_iq_jq_k,\qquad \varepsilon^{ijk}\bar{q_i}\bar{q_j}\bar{q_k},
\end{equation*}
which are the quark compositions of mesons, baryons, and antibaryons, respectively. 

One of the tests supporting the existence of colour and fractional electric charge came in the form of the ratio $R$, of the total cross-section of hadron production in \ee annihilations to the cross-section of a pair of muons produced from the same annihilation process. The virtual photon emitted in the annihilation can produce all electrically charged pairs of particles and antiparticles, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ee_to_ff_diagram}.

The ratio $R$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
    R = \frac{\sigma(e^+e^- \rightarrow \mathrm{hadrons})}{\sigma(e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-)} = N_c \sum_f Q_f^2\ ,
\end{equation*}
where $N_c$ represents the number of existing colours and $Q_f$ is the electric charge of the quark flavour $f$. Notably, this ratio depends on centre-of-mass energy (\sqs) and encompasses all possible quark flavours that can be produced by the virtual photon at that specific energy level. While at low energies (few \gev) only light quarks ($u,d,s$) are produced, at higher energies, heavier quarks like charm ($c$, \mbox{$M_c=1.2730\pm0.0046~\gevcc$}~\cite{pdg}) and beauty ($b, M_b=4.183\pm0.007~\gevcc$~\cite{pdg}) can be produced as well. The experimental measurements of $R$, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:R_vs_s}, exhibit a remarkable agreement with the predictions of the three-colour model, thereby providing compelling evidence for the existence of colour and fractional electric charge of quarks.

The final step that propelled the development of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) as a comprehensive theory of the strong force was the insight into the mechanism that ensured all hadron wavefunctions to be colour singlets. This emerged from the discovery of asymptotic freedom, a phenomenon observed in deep-inelastic scattering experiments. Non-Abelian gauge theories, often referred to as Yang-Mills theories, were identified as having this unique characteristic. This realisation led to the formulation of QCD by elevating the global colour $SU(3)$ symmetry to a local one, allowing the 8 quanta of the $SU(3)$ gauge field, called \emph{gluons}, to mediate the strong force, successfully describing the confinement and behavior of quarks and gluons within hadrons.

The QCD Lagrangian density can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lqcd}
    \mathcal{L}_{QCD}=-\frac{1}{4} F^a_{\mu\nu}F_a^{\mu\nu} + \sum_f \bar{q}_f^i (i\gamma^\mu(\mathcal{D}_\mu)_{ij}-m_f\delta_{ij})q_f^j\ ,
\end{equation}
where $F^a_{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor defined in terms of the gluon field $A^a_\mu$ and the $SU(3)$ structure constant $f^{abc}$ as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:F}
    F^a_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A^a_\nu - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu + g_s f^{abc}A^b_\mu A^c_\nu 
\end{equation}
and $(\mathcal{D}_\mu)_{ij}$ is the covariant derivative:
\begin{equation*}
    (\mathcal{D}_\mu)_{ij} = \partial_\mu \delta_{ij} - ig_s(t^a)_{ij}A_\mu^a\ ,
\end{equation*}
with $t^a$ being one of the generators of the $SU(3)$ representation.

The last term in Eq.~\ref{eq:F} is peculiar to non-Abelian theories, and gives rise to triplet and quartic gluon self-interactions illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:Feynman-gluons}. $g_s$ is a coupling parameter related to the strong coupling constant \als, which determines the strength of the interaction between the coloured particles.

The second term of Eq.~\ref{eq:Lqcd} describes the interactions between quarks and gluons, sketched in Fig.~\ref{fig:Feynman_q_g}, and contains the mass term for the fermions. It is noteworthy to observe that the interaction between quarks and gluons is diagonal in flavour, meaning that the strong interaction conserves the flavour of quarks. In contrast, colour mixing is allowed within the framework of QCD.

\subsection{Running coupling constant}
If one considers a dimensionless physical observable, denoted in the following as $R$, which solely depends on a single energy scale, $Q$, one might naturally expect $R$ to maintain a constant value, independent of the specific energy scale chosen. However, this does not hold true when loop diagrams are studied: the necessity of renormalisation introduces a new energy scale denoted as $\mu$. This scale, known as the renormalisation scale, is the point at which the subtraction of the ultraviolet divergences is carried out. Critically, $\mu$ is an arbitrary parameter and, as such, is non-physical. Consequently, $R$ becomes dependent on the ratio $Q^2/\mu^2$ and the renormalised coupling $\alpha_s = g_s^2/4\pi$: $R \equiv R\left(\frac{Q^2}{\mu^2},\als\right)$. The $\mu$ independence of $R$ (which is an essential requirement given $\mu$'s arbitrariness) can be expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:RGE}
    \mu^2 \frac{\de R\left(\frac{Q^2}{\mu^2},\alpha_s\right)}{\de \mu^2} = \mu^2 \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial\mu^2}+\frac{\partial \alpha_s}{\partial\mu^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha_s}\right]R\left(\frac{Q^2}{\mu^2},\alpha_s\right) = 0\ , 
\end{equation}
a fundamental equation known as the renormalisation group equation. This equation is exactly true in the case of a prediction that considers all perturbative orders. If one limits the expansion at a fixed order $\als^\mathrm{N}$, then a dependence of $R$ from $\mu$ is observed at the $\als^\mathrm{N+1}$ order. By introducing
\begin{equation*}
    t\equiv \mathrm{log}(Q^2/\mu^2), \qquad \beta(\als)\equiv \mu^2 \frac{\de\als}{\mathrm{\de\mu^2}}\quad ,
\end{equation*}
Eq.~\ref{eq:RGE} can be written as
\begin{equation*}
    \left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \beta(\als)\frac{\partial}{\partial \als}\right) R(e^t,\als) = 0\quad .
\end{equation*}
This first-order partial differential equation can be solved by defining a new function: the running coupling $\als(Q^2)$, which evolves as a function of $Q$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:t_integral}
    t = \mathrm{log}(Q^2/\mu^2) \equiv \int_{\als}^{\als(Q^2)} \frac{\de x}{\beta(x)} , \quad \mathrm{with}~\als=\als(\mu^2)\quad .
\end{equation}
By differentiating Eq.~\ref{eq:t_integral} with respect to $t$ and \als, one gets:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:beta_def}
    \beta(\als(Q^2)) = \frac{\partial\als(Q^2)}{\partial t}, \quad \frac{\de\als(Q^2)}{\de\als} = \frac{\beta(\als (Q^2))}{\beta(\als)}\quad .
\end{equation}
It results from this last set of equations that $R(1,\als(Q^2))$ satisfies Eq.~\ref{eq:RGE}; hence, the running coupling constant has absorbed the $\mu$ scale dependence of $R$. As a consequence, the knowledge of $R(1,\als)$, which can be evaluated in fixed-order perturbation theory, allows knowing the dependence of $R$ from $Q^2$, the physical scale at which the coupling is gauged, by simply substituting $\als \rightarrow \als(Q^2)$. 

\subsubsection{The \ensuremath{\beta} function}
The running of the coupling constant is determined by the $\beta(\als)$ function, which is evaluated from loop corrections to the bare vertices of QCD. As of the time of the writing of this Thesis, the $\beta$ function has been evaluated up to 5 loops~\cite{Herzog:2017ohr}. In Fig.~\ref{fig:beta_loops}, the 1-loop Feynman diagrams contributing to the $\beta$ function evaluation are reported.

By limiting the calculations at the first order in the perturbative expansion, one gets:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:beta0}
    \beta(\als) = -\als^2 \frac{11 \mathrm{N_c} - 2 \mathrm{N_f}}{12\pi} + \mathcal{O}(\als^3) \equiv -\als^2 \beta_0 + \mathcal{O}(\als^3)\quad ,
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{N_c}$ is the number of colours (3), while $\mathrm{N_f}$ is the number of quark flavours that can be considered massless at the physical scale $Q^2$ at which the coupling is being measured.
From Eqs.~\ref{eq:beta_def} and~\ref{eq:beta0}, one can extract the $Q^2$ dependency of the running coupling constant:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:alpha_s_running}
    \alpha_s(Q^2) = \frac{\alpha_s(\mu^2)}{1+\alpha_s(\mu^2)\beta_0 \mathrm{log}(Q^2/\mu^2)}\ ,
\end{equation}

Notably, since $\beta_0$ is positive in a six-quark-flavour framework, the strong coupling constant exhibits a monotonic decreasing trend as a function of $Q^2$. This behaviour differs from the one of the electromagnetic coupling constant, which increases with the energy scale due to the screening effect of vacuum polarisation. For QCD, the running of the coupling constant is a direct consequence of the non-Abelian nature of the theory, allowing for gluon self-interactions, which give rise to an anti-screening effect. The idea is that the emission of virtual gluons by static colour sources causes their colour charges to 'leak out' into the surrounding vacuum. Since the interaction between distributions of charges is weaker than the one between point-like charges when the distributions overlap, the effective coupling constant decreases at short distances. This behaviour is known as asymptotic freedom, a key feature of QCD that allows for the perturbative expansion of the theory at high energy scales, where the strong coupling constant is small. At the same time, the running of the coupling constant implies that the theory is non-perturbative at low energy scales, and phenomenological models are required to describe the strong interaction in this regime. 

Instead of using the renormalisation scale $\mu$ as a free parameter, one can use the running coupling constant to define a physical scale, $\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}$, which is the energy scale at which the coupling constant would diverge, if extrapolated outside the perturbative regime. Using Eq.~\ref{eq:alpha_s_running}, one can write
\begin{equation*}
    \alpha_s(\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}) = \frac{1}{\beta_0 \mathrm{log}(Q^2/\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}^2)}\quad .
\end{equation*}
The value of $\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}$ is determined by the specific definition being used. However, to obtain the value of the coupling constant measured at $Q^2 = M_\mathrm{Z}^2$, an approximate value of $\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}$ of around 200~\mev can be used.

Measurements of the running of the coupling constant at different values of $Q$ are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:alpha_s_running} and compared to the theoretical prediction at 5 loops. The agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical prediction is remarkable, confirming the validity of the QCD framework at high energy scales.

\section{Confinement}
The concept of confinement is one of the most intriguing aspects of QCD. It is the phenomenon by which quarks and gluons are never observed as free particles, but are always confined within colour-neutral hadrons. The confinement of quarks and gluons is a direct consequence of the non-Abelian nature of the theory, which, as described in the previous Section, is characterised by an increase in the strong coupling constant at low energy scales. The confinement of quarks and gluons is a non-perturbative effect, and despite extensive research, a comprehensive theoretical description of confinement in QCD remains elusive. Phenomenological models like the MIT bag model have been proposed, but a full comprehension of confinement is still lacking. Lattice QCD simulations are the most successful approach to study the non-perturbative regime of the theory, and they have provided a wealth of information on the properties of hadrons and the strong interaction at low energy scales.

\subsection{MIT bag model}
The MIT bag model~\cite{Johnson:1975zp} is a phenomenological model of confinement, which describes hadrons as bound states of quarks and gluons confined within a finite volume, called \emph{bag}. The model was developed in the 1970s by A. Chodos, R. L. Jaffe, K. Johnson, C. B. Thorn, and V. F. Weisskopf, and it has been widely used to study the properties of hadrons and strong interactions. In the MIT bag model, N non-interacting massless fermions are confined within a spherical cavity of radius $R$, which is the bag radius. The confinement arises from a balance between the pressure due to the kinetic energy of the fermions inside the bag and an ad hoc external pressure, which is introduced to confine the fermions within the bag. The fermions are described by the Dirac equation for massless fermions:

\begin{equation*}
    i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\psi = 0\quad ,
\end{equation*}
where $\psi$ is the fermion field, and $\gamma^\mu$ are the Dirac matrices. The solution to the Dirac equation is given in terms of the spherical Bessel functions of zeroth and first order, $j_0(p_0r)$ and $j_1(p_0r)$:

\begin{equation*}
    \psi = \mathcal{N} e^{-ip_0t} \begin{pmatrix} j_0(p_0r)\chi^+ \\ \vec{\sigma}\cdot\hat{r}j_1(p_0r)\chi^-\end{pmatrix}\quad ,
\end{equation*}
where $p_0$ is the energy of the fermion, $\chi^+$ and $\chi^-$ are the two components of the fermion four-dimensional spinor $\psi$, and $\vec{\sigma}$ are the Pauli matrices. The colour flux at a point $r$ inside the bag is given by

\begin{equation*}
    j_{ab}^\mu(r) = \bar{\psi_a}(r)\gamma^\mu\psi_b(r)\quad ,
\end{equation*}
where $a$ and $b$ are the colour indices of the fermions. If the quantum numbers are not to be lost through the surface of the bag, which is the definition of confinement, then, on the surface:

\begin{equation*}
  n_\mu j_{ab}^\mu(r) = \bar{\psi_a}(r)\gamma\cdot n \psi_b(r) = 0\quad ,
\end{equation*}
 where $n_\mu$ is a unit space-like vector perpendicular to the surface. Using the gamma properties, $(i\gamma\cdot n)^2 = 1$, so that by assuming that $i\gamma\cdot n = + 1$, the boundary condition on the surface of the bag is given by

\begin{equation*}
    \bar{\psi}(R)\psi(R) = 0\quad ,
\end{equation*}
leading to the solution of the Dirac equation in the bag:

\begin{equation*}
    \left[j_0\left(p_0R\right)\right]^2 - \left[j_1\left(p_0R\right)\right]^2 = 0\quad ,
\end{equation*}
with solution $p_0R = 2.04$. The total energy inside the bag is given by

\begin{equation*}
    E = \frac{2.04 \mathrm{N}}{R}(\hbar c) + \frac{4\pi}{3}R^3B\quad ,
\end{equation*}
where the first term is the kinetic energy of the fermions, and the second term is the energy due to the presence of an external pressure $B$ which keeps the fermions confined in the bag. The bag pressure is a phenomenological parameter of the model, and it is introduced to confine the fermions within the bag. It can be extracted by minimising the energy of the system with respect to the bag radius $R$, which yields $B=234$~\mev/fm$^3$ for a baryon with $R=0.8$ fm.

\subsection{Lattice QCD}
Lattice QCD is a numerical technique used to study the non-perturbative regime of QCD. The method is based on the discretisation of space-time on a four-dimensional lattice, and the evaluation of the path integral of the theory using Monte Carlo methods, i.e. by sampling possible configurations of the quark and gluon fields according to the probability distribution given by the QCD Lagrangian. The lattice spacing is a parameter of the method, and allows one to avoid the ultraviolet divergences of the theory, which are typical in perturbative QCD, by introducing a cutoff on the momenta of the quark and gluon fields. 
\begin{figure}[htb]

  \caption{Feynman introduction to path integrals. Here, a particle emitted from a source at $x_a$ is detected at $x_b$. A finite number of screens, each with a finite number of holes, is placed between the source and the detector. The probability amplitude for the particle to hit the detector is given by the sum of the probabilities of moving from the source to the detector through all possible paths. By adding an infinite amount of screens with an infinite number of holes, and by also considering the time at which the particle passes through each screen, the sum becomes an integral over all possible paths, called a \emph{path integral}.}
  \label{fig:PathIntegrals}
\end{figure}

The Lattice QCD simulations are based on the path integral formalism of quantum field theory~\cite{RevModPhys.20.367}, developed by R. Feynman in the 1940s. The path integral provides a natural extension to quantum mechanics of the least action principle of classical mechanics, and it allows one to calculate the probability amplitude of a particle to move from one point to another in space-time, considering the evolution of the system over all possible paths. The transition amplitude from the state $(x_a,t_a)$ to the state $(x_b,t_b)$ is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ampl_prob}
  A \left[(x_a,t_a) \rightarrow (x_b,t_b) \right] = \braket{x_b,t_b | e^{-iH(t_b-t_a)} | x_a,t_a} = \sum_\mathrm{paths} e^{iS[x(t)]}\quad , 
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the Hamiltonian of the system, $S[x(t)]$ is the action of the system for a given path $x(t)$, and the sum runs over all possible paths from $(x_a,t_a)$ to $(x_b,t_b)$. By taking the continuum limit on space-time, one obtains an integration over all the possible space-time paths of the system:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:path_integral}
  \sum_\mathrm{paths} e^{iS[x(t)]} \rightarrow \int_{x_a}^{x_b} \left[\mathcal{D}x(t)\right] e^{iS[x(t)]}\quad ,
\end{equation}
where the right-hand side term is a functional integral over all possible paths. It is interesting to note that by combining Eqs.~\ref{eq:ampl_prob} and \ref{eq:path_integral}, a quantity resembling the partition function of a statistical system is obtained:
\begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{Z} = \sum_{x_a} \braket{x_a,t_a | e^{\beta H} | x_a,t_a}\quad .
\end{equation*}
It is possible to express the partition function in terms of a path integral by applying a Wick rotation to the time variable, $t \rightarrow -i\tau$, with $\tau_a=0\leq\tau\leq\tau_b=\beta$ and considering the Euclidean action in place of the Minkowskian one, $S_\mathrm{E}=iS$. Furthermore, since the state at $\tau_a$ is the same as the one at $\tau_b$ in the partition function definition, a periodic boundary condition is imposed: $x(\tau_a) = x(\tau_b)$. With these considerations, the partition function can be expressed as
\begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{Z} = \int \left[\mathcal{D}x(\tau)\right] e^{-S_\mathrm{E}[x(\tau)]}\quad .
\end{equation*}
This formalism, which was here developed for a single particle, can be extended to a quantum field theory, and in particular to QCD.

Lattice QCD simulations are computationally intensive, and they require large supercomputers to perform the calculations. To limit the computational costs, calculations are often performed at larger up and down quark masses than in nature, drastically reducing the number of virtual quark-antiquark loops that have to be taken into account. Because of the employed Monte Carlo approach, only a finite number of configurations can be considered, leading to statistical uncertainties in the lattice QCD results. In order to obtain physical results, several limits have to be taken: i) the continuum limit, i.e. the extrapolation of the lattice spacing to zero, ii) the infinite-volume limit, i.e. the extrapolation of the lattice size to infinity, and iii) the physical quark-mass limit, i.e. the extrapolation to physical quark masses. Many present-day lattice calculations are already performed directly at, or very close to, the physical values of the quark masses~\cite{BMW:2008jgk,BMW:2014pzb,Bazavov:2017dus}, so that the latter extrapolation becomes less of an issue. 

The results of the lattice QCD simulations are in good agreement with the experimental data as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:LQCD_hadron_mass} for the spectrum of hadron masses obtained from lattice QCD simulations, taken from Ref.~\cite{BMW:2008jgk}.

\section{Quark--Gluon Plasma}
The concept of deconfinement refers to the transition from a confined state to a state where quarks and gluons are no longer confined within colour-neutral hadrons, but can move in a larger volume. As modelled by the MIT bag model, non-perturbative QCD effects can be described in terms of an external pressure, which confines quarks and gluons within a finite volume. If the external pressure is overcome by the pressure due to the kinetic energy of the quarks and gluons, then the hadrons constituents are no longer confined, and a transition to a state called Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) occurs. Lattice QCD calculations are used to understand the properties of the QGP, and they predict that a strongly interacting system with zero net baryon density evolves smoothly from a confined (hadronic) towards a deconfined (partonic) state when its temperature is increased up to $\sim155$~\mev~\cite{HotQCD:2014kol, Borsanyi:2013bia} ($1.8\times 10^{12}$ K, around $10^6$ times the temperature of the core of the Sun), reaching energy densities of $\sim 0.5$~\gev/fm$^3$~\cite{Bazavov:2017dus}.

  \label{fig:PhaseDiagram}
\end{figure}

It is believed that the Universe underwent a phase of deconfinement in the early stages of its evolution, few microseconds after the Big Bang~\cite{rafelski2014traveling}. Direct observation of the primordial QGP (i.e. that created just after the Big Bang) would provide a wealth of information on the early Universe; however, the Universe experienced a phase in which electrons were not bound into atoms (electromagnetic plasma), making it opaque to electromagnetic radiation, and denying us the possibility of directly observing the primordial QGP. Once the Universe cooled enough (3000~K) to allow electrons to bind to nuclei, the electromagnetic radiation decoupled with a black body spectrum of around 3000 K. Since then, as the Universe expanded, this electromagnetic radiation has redshifted to a temperature of around 2.7~K, and is denoted as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CBM). The CMB is the oldest light in the Universe and provides a snapshot of the Universe when it was 300'000 years old, long after the QGP phase. Although recent studies evidenced the presence of QGP in massive neutron star cores~\cite{Annala:2019puf}, a more controlled environment for studying the QGP is achieved by recreating it in laboratories, through the collision of heavy ions at ultra-relativistic energies. In the past decades, several experiments~\cite{ALICE:2022wpn, NA38:2000wlp, NA50:1997hlx, Nouicer:2009fy} have been carried out to study the properties of this state of matter, and the results have provided valuable insights into the properties of the strongly-interacting matter.

\subsection{High-energy heavy-ion collisions}
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Figures/Chapter 1/Bild_18.pdf}
  \caption{Space-time evolution of a heavy-ion collision. Figure taken from Ref.~\cite{Stock:2008ru}.}
  \label{fig:HeavyIonCollisions}
\end{figure}
Heavy-ion collisions are the most suitable environment to study the properties of the QGP in the laboratory. In these collisions, two heavy ions, such as lead or gold nuclei, are accelerated to ultra-relativistic energies and made to collide. Given the large amount of energy deposited in the collision, the system reaches high energy densities (of around 16 \gev/fm$^3$ after 1 fm/$c$ for central collisions at the LHC~\cite{Loizides:2011ys}), which allow for the production of the QGP for temperatures $T>T_\mathrm{pc}$, where $T_\mathrm{pc}$ is the pseudo-critical temperature for the transition to a deconfined state, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}. As nuclei are objects made of many nucleons (i.e.\ protons and neutrons), the interaction volume (called \emph{fireball}) is larger and longer-lived than in proton-proton collisions, allowing the usage of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics to describe the system created in the collision. 

It is possible to distinguish between two different collision regimes, which probe different phase spaces in the QCD diagram reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:PhaseDiagram}. The ordinary nuclear matter is located at approximately $T\sim0$ and $\mu_mathrm{B}=1$~\gev, where $\mu_mathrm{B}$ is the baryo-chemical potential, expressing the energy needed to increase the baryon number of the system by one unit, as described in Sec.~\ref{subsec:SHM}. When the centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair (\snn) is below a few \gev, the nucleons of the colliding nuclei are stopped in the collision as they lose energy and momentum. Due to conserved currents, the quantum numbers of the initial state are preserved, so that, for example, the net baryon production (i.e. the difference between the number of produced baryons and antibaryons) is positive. This regime is called \emph{stopping regime}. In this regime, the baryo-chemical potential is increased by about 5--10 times with respect to that of nuclear matter. When the \snn increases, the initial state baryon number is carried away by the receding nucleons, and the net baryon number in the fireball at midrapidity ($y\sim0$) is zero. The rapidity is defined as 
\begin{equation*}
    y = \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{log}\left(\frac{E+p_z}{E-p_z}\right)\quad ,
\end{equation*}
where $E$ is the energy and $p_z$ is the longitudinal momentum of the particle. In this regime, denoted as \emph{Bjorken regime}, or \emph{transparency regime}, high temperatures of a few hundred \mev are reached, and $\mu_\mathrm{B}$ is close to 0.   

The collision of two nuclei is a rather complex process, with a space-time evolution that can be divided into several stages, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:HeavyIonCollisions}. They can be studied by measuring different final-state observables that are sensitive to such stages. One of the first descriptions of the fireball evolution was given by J. Bjorken~\cite{Bjorken:1982qr}, who proposed a simple model to describe the expansion of the system in the longitudinal direction. In this model, it is assumed that there exists a central-plateau structure in the inclusive particle productions as a function of rapidity. In other terms, the Bjorken model assumes that the system is boost-invariant, i.e. independent of the longitudinal velocity. According to this model, the evolution of the system is described by the following stages: i) collision of the two nuclei, ii) pre-equilibrium, iii) QGP formation and expansion, iv) hadronisation and hadron gas expansion, and v) freeze-out.

\subsubsection{Collision}
The two nuclei are accelerated to ultra-relativistic energies and are thus Lorentz-contracted in the direction of motion. The collision takes place in a very short time $\tau_\mathrm{coll} = 2R/\gamma$, where R is the nucleus radius and $\gamma$ the Lorentz factor. At LHC energies, the crossing time of the nuclei is of $\sim 0.005$~fm/$c$, which is much smaller than the time scale of the strong interaction $\tau_\mathrm{strong} \sim 1/\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD} \sim 1$~fm/$c$. Particles produced in the collision through parton interactions mediated by the strong force are thus created once the colliding nuclei have already passed through each other and moved away from the interaction region. During the collision, a large amount of energy is deposited in the interaction region, leading to the formation of a fireball with high energy densities.

\subsubsection{Pre-equilibrium}
After $\tau_\mathrm{coll}$, secondary particles are produced from the energy deposited in the collision. In the Bjorken regime, it is possible to evaluate the energy density of the system as a function of time by measuring the transverse energy of the particles produced at midrapidity, where the net baryon density is zero. The energy density is given by
\begin{equation*}
    \varepsilon_\mathrm{Bjorken} = \frac{\braket{m_\mathrm{T}}}{\tau A} \left. \frac{\de N}{\de y}\right\rvert_{y=0} = \frac{1}{\tau A}\left. \left\langle\frac{\de E_\mathrm{T}}{\de y}\right\rangle\right\rvert_{y=0} \quad ,
\end{equation*}
where $A$ is the transverse area collision region, $\braket{m_\mathrm{T}}$ is the mean transverse mass, defined as $m_\mathrm{T} = \sqrt{m^2 + \pt^2}$, $N$ is the number of secondary particles, and $\braket{\de E_\mathrm{T}/\de y}$ is the mean transverse energy density. It is interesting to evaluate the energy densities reached at the time of particle formation, which can be estimated using Heisemberg's uncertainty principle: $\tau = \hbar/m_\mathrm{T}$. The mean transverse mass of the particles produced in the collision at the proper time of formation $\tau_\mathrm{f}$ can be evaluated using the approximate formula:
\begin{equation*}
    \braket{\mt} = \frac{\frac{\de \et(\tau_\mathrm{f})}{\de y}}{\frac{\de N(\tau_\mathrm{f})}{\de y}}\sim \left. \frac{\frac{\de \et}{\de \eta}}{\frac{\de N}{\de \eta}}\right\rvert_\mathrm{final~state}\quad ,
\end{equation*}
leading to a formation time of $\sim 0.35$~fm/$c$ in Au--Au collisions at $\snn=200$~\gevc at RHIC~\cite{PHENIX:2004vcz}, to which corresponds an energy density of $\sim 15$~\gev/fm$^3$. Measurements at LHC energies yield a higher energy density than RHIC by about a factor of 2.3~\cite{ALICE:2016igk}.

\subsubsection{Quark-gluon plasma formation}
The system of produced particles reaches thermal equilibrium through multiple scatterings at a proper time $\tau_\mathrm{eq}$, and the QGP is formed. Its evolution can be described using relativistic hydrodynamics. Studies at RHIC allow to constrain $\tau_\mathrm{eq}$ in the range of $0.6<\tau_\mathrm{eq}<1$~fm/$c$, corresponding to energy densities of $5.4 < \varepsilon_\mathrm{Bjorken}(\tau_\mathrm{eq})< 9$~\gev/fm$^3$, well above the threshold for QGP formation.
\subsubsection{Hadronisation}
The deconfined system expands and cools down, until the temperature decreases below the pseudo-critical value for the transition crossover ($T_\mathrm{pc}\sim 155-165$~\mev). The QGP undergoes a transition and hadronises, producing an expanding gas of colour-neutral particles. At LHC energies, this is expected to happen $\sim 10$~fm/$c$~\cite{ALICE:2011dyt} after the QGP formation. This transition is associated with a sharp decrease in the entropy density of the system.

\subsubsection{Freeze-out}
During the hadron gas expansion, the particle density decreases to a point where the inelastic interactions cease. The moment in which this happens is called \emph{chemical freeze-out}, and takes place at around $T_\mathrm{chem.}\sim160$~\mev~\cite{Andronic:2017pug}. This temperature value is very close to $T_\mathrm{pc}$, suggesting that the chemical freeze-out takes place very close to, or simultaneously with, the hadronisation. The chemical composition of the hadron gas cannot vary anymore, although elastic interactions, which change the momentum spectrum of the produced particles still occur. Once the temperature decreases below $T_\mathrm{therm.}\sim 130$~\mev, the elastic interactions cease as well, and this is referred to as \emph{thermal freeze-out}. The particles then keep expanding without interactions (\emph{free-streaming}), and are detected by the experimental apparatus.

\subsection{Hadron species abundances}\label{subsec:SHM}
Measurements of the multiplicity of identified hadron species, i.e., the chemical composition of the system, allow for the investigation of various properties of the system at the time of chemical freeze-out. The relative abundances of different hadron species produced in hadronic collisions are found to be well described by the \emph{Statistical Hadronisation Model} (SHM)~\cite{Braun-Munzinger:2003pwq}. The SHM is based on the assumption that the fireball created in an ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision is in thermal and chemical equilibrium at the time of chemical freeze-out, which is assumed to be characterised by the same temperature for all the hadronic species.

A system is in thermal equilibrium when the distribution of particle velocities follows a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which depends solely on the temperature of the system. Chemical equilibrium is achieved when the relative multiplicities of the different hadron species are described by their mass, spin degeneracy, and the temperature of the system. The hypothesis of thermal and chemical equilibrium is postulated, and allows the use of statistical mechanics to describe the system by defining a partition function that characterises the statistical properties of a system in equilibrium. The validity of this assumption is then verified a posteriori by comparing the model predictions with the experimental data. The equilibrium at the chemical freeze-out is purely statistical, i.e. the particle abundances are determined through the principle of maximum entropy, which suggests that hadronisation fills the phase space in the most probable configuration. Furthermore, the SHM does not take into account the dynamics of the system, but only its state at the time of the chemical freeze-out, without any assumption on the presence of a partonic phase. 

The system is described in the SHM picture in terms of a non-interacting gas of hadrons and resonances, which corresponds, in a Yukawa approach, to a hadron gas interacting through the exchange of resonances. This framework was found to be consistent with the equation of state of strongly-interacting matter from lattice QCD for temperatures below the pseudo-critical temperature of the QCD phase transition~\cite{HotQCD:2014kol}. 

The ensemble used to describe the system is the grand canonical ensemble, which describes a system exchanging energy and particles with the environment. In a grand canonical ensemble, the energy and the quantum numbers are conserved on average, but not exactly and locally as in a micro canonical ensemble. The fireball produced in an ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision can be described in terms of small clusters that exchange energy and particles with the rest of the system. Smaller collision systems such as pp and \ee collisions, where fewer particles are produced, are described by the canonical ensemble, where the quantum numbers are conserved exactly and locally, while the energy is conserved on average.

The density of the hadron species i in the system can be calculated from the partition function $Z_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{GC}$ and is given by
\begin{equation*}
    n_i = \frac{1}{V} \frac{\partial(TZ_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{GC})}{\partial\mu_\mathrm{i}} = \frac{g_\mathrm{i}T^2}{2\pi^2}\sum_\mathrm{k=1}^\infty \frac{(\pm1)^\mathrm{k+1}}{k}\lambda_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{k}m^2_\mathrm{i} K_2\left(\frac{\mathrm{k}m_\mathrm{i}}{T}\right) \quad ,
\end{equation*}
where $V$ is the volume of the system, $g_\mathrm{i}$, $\lambda_\mathrm{i} = e^{\mu_\mathrm{i}/T}$ and $m_\mathrm{i}$ are the degeneracy factor, the fugacity, and the mass of the hadron species i, respectively. The $+$ sign holds for bosons, while the $-$ sign is for fermions. $K_2$ is the second-order modified Bessel function of the second kind. The chemical potential $\mu_\mathrm{i}$ of the hadron species i is related to the conservation (on average, on a large volume) of the quantum numbers of the system. It is given by $\mu = \sum_\mathrm{j} \mu_{Q_\mathrm{j}}  Q_\mathrm{j}$, where $Q_\mathrm{j}$ are the conserved quantum numbers (third component of isospin, strangeness, and baryon number), and $\mu_{Q_\mathrm{j}}$ are the chemical potentials, which guarantee the conservation of the conserved charges. $\mu_\mathrm{i}$ is thus the energy needed to add a particle with quantum numbers $Q_\mathrm{j}$ to the system. The obtained multiplicities of the hadron species are then corrected with a feed-down contribution from decays of short-lived particles, which cannot be detected directly.

Of the five free parameters of the SHM ($T$, $\mu_{B}$, $\mu_{s}$, $\mu_{I_\mathrm{3}}$, and $V$), two can be fixed through conservation of the initial state quantum numbers. Particle abundances are typically fitted in terms of the temperature $T$, the baryon chemical potential $\mu_{B}$ and the volume of the system $V$.

\begin{sloppypar}
Figure~\ref{fig:SHM_fit} illustrates the yields of different identified hadron species measured by the ALICE Collaboration in the 10\% most central Pb--Pb collisions at \mbox{$\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$~\tev}. They are compared to predictions from various implementations of the SHM, including THERMUS~\cite{Wheaton:2004qb}, GSI-Heidelberg~\cite{Andronic:2005yp}, SHARE~\cite{Torrieri:2004zz}, and Thermal-FIST~\cite{Vovchenko:2019pjl}. These models make different assumptions regarding the equilibrium condition and/or conservation laws at the chemical freeze-out stage. The SHM is capable of describing the different particle abundances, which span a large range of 9 orders of magnitude. The yields of exotic hadron species, such as hyperons and light nuclei are precisely described too. This confirms the assumption that the system is in thermal and chemical equilibrium at the time of the chemical freeze-out, and that the outcome of the hadronisation process is well described by a statistical approach.
\end{sloppypar}

The chemical freeze-out temperature is found to be of $\sim 155$~\mev, very close to that predicted by lattice QCD calculations for QCD phase transition. Most recent results from the ALICE Collaboration~\cite{ALICE:2023ulv} show that the measured electric charge and baryon chemical potentials at midrapidity at the LHC energies are compatible with 0, indicating that the system created in Pb--Pb collisions at the LHC is on average baryon free and electrically neutral.

\subsection{Radial flow}
After the chemical freeze-out, inelastic interactions between hadrons do not take place anymore. However, elastic interactions can still occur in the hadron gas, leading to a modification of the momentum distribution of the particles until the system reaches the thermal freeze-out. By studying the transverse momentum spectra of the particles produced in the collision, it is possible to extract information on the properties of the produced particles at the thermal freeze-out, and on the collective expansion (\emph{flow}) of the system.

For a stationary thermal source with a temperature $T$, the Lorentz-invariant momentum distribution of the particles is given by
\begin{equation*}
    E\frac{\de^3 N}{\de p^3} = \frac{\de^3 N}{\pt\de\pt\de\varphi\de y} = \frac{g_\mathrm{i}V}{(2\pi)^3} E \frac{1}{e^{(E-\mu_\mathrm{i})/T}\pm1}\quad ,
\end{equation*}
where $E$ is the energy of the particle, $g_\mathrm{i}$ and $\mu_\mathrm{i}$ are the degeneracy factor and chemical potential of the particles of species i, respectively, $V$ is the volume of the source, and the +1 term is for fermions while the $-1$ is for bosons. By using the relation
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\de N}{\pt\de\pt} = \frac{\de N}{\mt\de\mt}\quad ,
\end{equation*}
and by assuming that $e^{(E-\mu_\mathrm{i})/T}\gg1$, the transverse momentum spectrum of particles can be obtained by integrating over the azimuthal angle $\varphi$ and the rapidity $y$, leading to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mt_scaling}
    \frac{\de N}{\mt\de\mt} = \frac{g_\mathrm{i}V}{(2\pi)^2} \mt e^{\mu_\mathrm{i}/T} K_1\left(\frac{\mt}{T}\right) \xrightarrow[\mt\gg T]{} V'\sqrt{\mt}e^{-\mt/T}\quad .
\end{equation}
From Eq.~\ref{eq:mt_scaling} emerges that for a stationary thermal particle source with a temperature $T$, the transverse mass spectrum of the particles follows an exponential distribution with a slope parameter $T$, and is independent of the particle species. This is known as the \mt-scaling of the transverse mass spectra, and is observed in pp and small-system collisions at low \sqs, with a slope parameter of $T\sim167$~\mev~\cite{Heinz:2004qz}. However, in heavy-ion collisions, this description is not valid, as the QGP, which is a thermalised system of deconfined quarks and gluons, has a thermal pressure. The pressure difference between the QGP and the surrounding vacuum leads to a collective expansion of the fireball, which is called \emph{radial flow}. This causes the particles to be pushed in the transverse direction, causing a modification of the transverse momentum spectra of the particles, which is characterised by a shift of the spectra towards higher \pt values, with a more pronounced effect for heavier particles, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RadialFlow}, where the \pt distributions measured by the ALICE Collaboration~\cite{ALICE:2022wpn} of different hadron species are shown for central (0--5\%) and peripheral (80--90\%) Pb--Pb collisions. The radial flow, as expected, is more pronounced in central collisions (due to the larger pressure gradients) which is manifest in the harder \pt spectra for central collisions as compared to peripheral ones. The radial flow is determined by a correlation between the velocity of an element of the system and its space-time position, which is superimposed on the random thermal motion of the particles.

  \label{fig:blast_wave_fit}
\end{figure}

The radial flow can be described by using phenomenological models, such as the blast-wave model~\cite{Schnedermann:1993ws}, which assumes that the particles are emitted from a thermal source with a collective velocity field. It relies on the Cooper-Frye prescription~\cite{Cooper:1974mv}, which assumes an instantaneous freeze-out of the particles in the radial direction, to calculate the transverse momentum spectra of the particles in terms of the temperature of the source, the collective velocity field, and the transverse velocity profile. Results from SPS, RHIC, and LHC experiments show that the transverse momentum spectra of the particles produced in heavy-ion collisions can be well described by the blast-wave model, with a temperature of the source (which corresponds to the thermal freeze-out temperature $T_\mathrm{therm.}$) of around 110--120~\mev, almost independent of \snn, and a collective velocity field of around 0.5--0.6~$c$ in the most central collisions, with a growing trend with \snn, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:blast_wave_fit}.

Hydrodynamics-based models provided a more robust description of the system's expansion as compared to blast-wave fits. They rely on energy and momentum conservation laws, which need to be expressed in a relativistic form due to the relativistic nature of the system:
\begin{equation*}
    \partial_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0\quad ,~\mathrm{with}\quad T^{\mu\nu} = (\varepsilon + p)u^\mu u^\nu - p g^{\mu\nu}\quad ,
\end{equation*}
where $T^{\mu\nu}$ is the energy-momentum tensor, $\varepsilon$ is the energy density, $p$ is the pressure, $u^\mu$ is the four-velocity of the fluid element, and $g^{\mu\nu}$ is the metric tensor. An additional condition comes from the conservation of the baryon number, which is expressed as
\begin{equation*}
    \partial_\mu (n_B u^\mu) = 0\quad ,
\end{equation*}
where $n_B$ is the baryon density. A further equation is needed to close the system of equations, and is provided by the equation of state of the QGP, which relates the pressure to the energy density and the baryon density. As the fireball is in a non-equilibrium state in the early stages of the collision, the hydrodynamics equations need an initial condition to describe the system at the time $\tau_\mathrm{eq}$ in which it reaches the equilibrium and hydrodynamics can be applied. This is usually obtained via the Glauber~\cite{Miller:2007ri} or $\mathrm{T_RENTo}~\cite{Moreland:2014oya}$ models, which describe the collision of the two nuclei as a superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions, and provide the initial energy density profile of the system. Models based on the Colour Glass Condensate framework such as IP-Glasma~\cite{Lappi:2006fp}, or Monte Carlo simulations based on the description of partonic showers such as AMPT~\cite{Lin:2004en} can also be used to provide the initial conditions for the hydrodynamics calculations. \\
The hydrodynamics calculations provide a good description of the transverse momentum spectra of the particles produced in heavy-ion collisions, and the emerging parameters (freeze-out temperature, flow velocity) are similar to those obtained with the blast-wave model. In addition, hydrodynamics calculations and their extensions, such as viscous hydrodynamics, can be used to study other observables related to the collective expansion of the system, such as the elliptic flow, which is a measure of the anisotropy of the particle emission in the transverse plane.

High-\pt partons are produced in hard-scattering processes, i.e., those with a high momentum transfer. As such, they are produced in the early stages of the collision and experience the whole fireball evolution. They can therefore be used to probe the properties of the earliest stages of the QGP. The Glauber model predicts the production cross-section of hard-scattering processes to scale with the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions. To test this prediction, the nuclear modification factor \raa is defined as the ratio of the \pt-differential hadron yield in heavy-ion collisions to the one in proton-proton collisions, scaled by the mean number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions $\langle N_\mathrm{coll} \rangle$:
\begin{equation*}
    \raa = \frac{\de N_\mathrm{AA}/\de\pt}{\langle N_\mathrm{coll} \rangle~\de N_\mathrm{pp}/\de\pt}\quad .
\end{equation*}
The nuclear modification factor of particles produced in hard-scattering processes (jets, high \pt hadrons, heavy flavours) is expected to be equal to unity, namely \emph{binary scaling}, in the absence of nuclear effects. However, experimental results~\cite{ALICE:2018vuu} show that the \raa of charged particles measured in the most central heavy-ion collisions exhibits a suppression at low \pt, a peak at intermediate \pt ($\sim 2~\gevc$), and a significant suppression by a factor of $\sim5$ at high \pt, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RAA}. The suppression at low \pt and the peak at intermediate \pt are mostly attributed to soft particle production, which dominates at low \pt and does not scale with $N_\mathrm{coll}$. In addition, other initial-state effects, such as the modification of parton distribution functions in the nucleus~\cite{Arneodo:1992wf}, and the Cronin effect~\cite{Kopeliovich:2002yh} modify the spectra in Pb--Pb (and p--Pb) collisions as compared to pp. In addition, the radial flow causes a modification of the spectral shapes at low \pt and affects the \raa. The initial-state effects can be studied in small collision systems~\cite{PHENIX:2021dod}, where the production of a QGP is not expected, or through the measurement of the \raa for colour-neutral particles, such as photons~\cite{PHENIX:2012jbv}, which are not affected by the presence of a deconfined medium. The high-\pt suppression of \raa increases with collision centrality and is related to the formation of the QGP. Partons traversing the medium lose energy through elastic scatterings with the QGP constituents and via gluon radiation, which is the dominant process for high-energy partons. This energy loss can be described in the BDMPS formalism~\cite{Baier:1996kr}, which assumes that the radiated gluon becomes de-coherent from the emitting parton through multiple soft scatterings with the medium constituents. The energy loss of the partons is quantified as
\begin{equation*}
    \Delta E = \frac{1}{4}\alpha_s C_\mathrm{R}\hat{q}L^2\quad ,
\end{equation*}
Where \als is the strong coupling constant, $C_\mathrm{R}$ is the Casimir factor, which is 3 for gluon-gluon couplings and 4/3 for quark-gluon interactions, $\hat{q}$ is the transport coefficient, and $L$ is the path length of the parton in the medium. The transport coefficient is related to the energy density of the medium, as $\hat{q} \propto \varepsilon^{3/4}$~\cite{Baier:2002tc}, so that energy loss measurements can be used to infer the properties of the QGP. Typical energy losses of high-\pt partons traversing the whole QGP are of the order of 40~\gev, which is a significant fraction of the parton energy. The energy loss of the partons leads to a suppression of high-\pt hadron yield, which consequently leads to a suppression of the nuclear modification factor at high \pt.

\end{figure}

At leading order, partons are produced in back-to-back pairs, forming what are known as di-jets. In the presence of the QGP, the jets are expected to be modified due to the interactions with the medium, an effect known as \emph{jet quenching}. For example, the opening angle of the jets is observed to be broadened~\cite{ALICE:2015tra}, and the \pt distribution of the leading hadron (i.e., the one with the highest \pt) is expected to be softer than that measured in pp collisions~\cite{ATLAS:2017xfa}, therefore yielding an \raa smaller than unity at high \pt. 

Further insights into the jet quenching mechanism can be obtained by measuring two-particle azimuthal correlations. For each event, the particle with the highest \pt above a certain threshold is selected as the trigger particle, and the azimuthal angle of other high-\pt particles is measured with respect to the first one. For proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions, the azimuthal distribution presents two peaks: the \emph{near-side peak}, which is found at $\varphi=0$ and is due to the hadrons produced in the same jet as the trigger particle, and the \emph{away-side peak}, which is found at $\varphi=\pi$ and is due to the hadrons produced in the opposite jet. In heavy-ion collisions, the away-side peak is suppressed due to the energy loss in the QGP, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:azimuthal_correlations}. In fact, for a di-jet surface emission, the parton shower generated by the jet pointing in the direction of the medium is expected to lose more energy than the one pointing in the opposite direction, yielding the suppression of the away-side peak.

%In addition, the QGP can also affect the hadronisation process. In small collision systems, such as pp and p--Pb collisions, hadronisation occurs via fragmentation, where the colour string holding together a quark-antiquark pair breaks, producing another quark-antiquark pair. This process leads to the production of a collimated jet of hadrons with \pt lower than the one of the first quark-antiquark pair. When the QGP is produced, another hadronisation mechanism becomes available, as the QGP is a thermalised system: the coalescence (or recombination) mechanism. Low \pt partons close in the velocity-space phase space can bind together to form a higher-\pt hadron. This enhances the production of baryons, as the \pt-distribution of partons inside the QGP follows a rapidly decreasing trend.

\subsection{Strangenness enhancement}\label{subsec:StrangenessEnhancement}
One of the first proposed signatures of the QGP formation is the strangeness enhancement~\cite{Rafelski:1982pu}, which refers to the observation of an increased production of strange hadrons in heavy-ion collisions compared to proton-proton collisions. At a microscopic level, the enhancement of strange hadrons is a direct consequence of the high temperatures reached in the QGP, which allow for the thermal production of strange quarks and antiquarks. Strange quarks are not present as valence quarks in the initial state, and can be produced in hard $2\rightarrow 2$ scatterings ($gg\rightarrow s\overline{s},~q\overline{q}\rightarrow s\overline{s}$), or via gluon splitting ($g\rightarrow s\overline{s}$) during the evolution of the system. While these processes are dominant for the production of strange hadrons with high \pt, at low \pt the production of strangeness is dominated by non-perturbative processes. At a macroscopic level, the enhancement of the production of strange hadrons in the presence of QGP can be explained using the statistical approach of the SHM. The description of hadron production in smaller colliding systems, such as $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ and pp collisions, requires the use of a canonical ensemble, which is used to describe a system that exchanges only energy with a reservoir, and requires the exact (local) conservation of quantum numbers. This reduces the phase space available for strange particle production~\cite{Redlich:2001kb}, leading to a suppression of strange quark production as compared to the grand canonical ensemble, called \emph{canonical suppression}. 

The strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions has been observed by several Collaborations, such as the WA97~\cite{WA97:1999uwz} and NA57~\cite{NA57:2010tnk} at the SPS, STAR at RHIC~\cite{STAR:2007cqw}, and ALICE at the LHC~\cite{ALICE:2013xmt}. In addition, an enhancement of strange hadrons has been observed in small systems, such as pp~\cite{ALICE:2016fzo} and p-Pb~\cite{ALICE:2013wgn, ALICE:2015mpp} collisions, in high-multiplicity events, and follows a hierarchy determined by the hadron strangeness. This observation is intriguing, as QGP production is not expected in such systems. Furthermore, several effects such as azimuthal correlations and mass-dependent hardening of \pt distributions, which are typically associated with QGP formation in nuclear collisions, have been observed in these systems. Could small droplets of QGP be formed in these collisions? Could other mechanisms explain the observed effects? These are still open questions in the field of high-energy nuclear physics, and they are the subjects of ongoing research.

Figure~\ref{fig:StrangenessEnhancement} shows the \pt-integrated yield ratios of strange (\kzs, $\Lambda$) and multi-strange ($\Xi^\pm, \Omega^\pm$) hadrons to pions ($\pi^++\pi^-$) as a function of the charged particle multiplicity density, $\braket{\de N_\mathrm{ch}/\de\eta}$, measured in $\lvert y\rvert<0.5$ in different collision systems (pp, p--Pb and Pb--Pb) by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC~\cite{ALICE:2016fzo}. The data show a clear enhancement of strange to non-strange hadron production with a smooth trend with increasing multiplicity. At the highest multiplicities of Pb--Pb collisions, the yield ratios saturate at values that are described by SHM calculations with a grand canonical ensemble. This can be interpreted as a consequence of the formation of a QGP in Pb-Pb collisions, where the $\mathrm{s\overline{s}}$ is expected to rapidly reach its equilibrium value.


%In the QGP, strange quarks are produced through the interactions between the quarks and gluons, and they can form strange hadrons, such as the $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, and $\Omega$ baryons. The production of strange hadrons in heavy-ion collisions is a key signature of the QGP, and it has been observed in several experiments, such as the ALICE experiment at the LHC~\cite{ALICE:2022wpn}.
